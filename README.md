# 2025 Testbeam Analysis

This repository contains all code and utilities developed for the 2025 ENUBET testbeam data analysis, in particolar to share code to obtain the timing resolution for our detectors. 

---

## Contents
- C++ scripts for timing and amplitude extraction tools
- Fitting functions for Polya and Gaussian distributions
- ...?

---

## Collaboration

This repository is designed for active collaboration. Feel free to:
- Push experimental branches and test new approaches
- Add notes or comments explaining new methods or assumptions (I'll try to put them at the beginning of each script)
- Suggest improvements to existing scripts

---

## Requirements
- ROOT (latest stable version recommended)
- C++17 or newer

---

## Notes

This repository is evolving continuously as new insights emerge from the testbeam data. Each user is encouraged to document changes and observations directly in the code or via commit messages to maintain clarity and traceability!
